### What is MDX?

[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a text formatting language that allows you to write JSX in your markdown files. It differs from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) in the way that it allows you to write JSX components directly in your markdown text. This is useful for creating interactive content like tutorials, documentation, and blog posts.
